### Implementation Details:
- **Language**: Fully implemented in Java.
- **Libraries**: Uses only the standard Java library.
- **Data Serialization**: Java's object serialization is used for data management.
- **Data Persistence**: Does not use any modern Database, works purely on Local file system, handles everything with java objects, a simple data access layer written from scratch.
- **Lazy Loading**: Complex relation ships like Sessions and Exams are loaded incrementally as the user proceeds.
- **Cacheing**: Caches recent queries temporarily on RAM (not tested yet).
- **Data Processing**: Leverages Javaâ€™s Stream API for sequential and parallel processing.
- **User Interface**: provides a simple and intuitive UI/UX

     > Example:
     > performs intuitive filtering through user inputs over large numbers of items (list of students)

### Performance Testing:
The application was tested with the following data:
- 100 faculty members
- 1400 students
- 40 courses
- 10 exams per course
- 4 courses per student
- 4 courses per faculty member
- 15 sessions per course per faculty member

During testing, **rare bugs emerged** due to the use of **parallel streams** in Java, which led to unexpected behavior under certain conditions.
